)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdm}{CDMConnector reference object}

\item{ingredients}{vector of ingredients, by default: acetaminophen}

\item{subsetToConceptId}{vector of concept IDs of the ingredients
to filter. If a concept ID is positive it will be included, a negative one will be excluded.
If NULL, all concept IDs for an ingredient will be considered.}

\item{checks}{the checks to be executed, by default the missing values, the
exposure duration and the quantity. Possible options are "missing",
"exposureDuration", "type", "route", "sourceConcept", "daysSupply",
"verbatimEndDate", "dose", "sig", "quantity", "daysBetween" and "diagnosticsSummary"}

\item{minCellCount}{minimum number of events to report- results
lower than this will be obscured. If 0 all results will be reported.}

\item{sample}{the number of samples, default 10.000}

\item{tablePrefix}{The stem for the permanent tables that will
be created when running the diagnostics. Permanent tables will be created using
this prefix, and any existing tables that start with this will be at risk of
being dropped or overwritten. If NULL, temporary tables will be
used throughout.}

\item{earliestStartDate}{the earliest date from which a record can be included}

\item{verbose}{verbose, default FALSE}

\item{byConcept}{boolean argument whether to return results by Concept or overall only}

\item{exposureTypeId}{id of the drug exposure type to be filtered on (e.g. only prescribed).
By default all record types will be taken into account.}

\item{outputFolder}{folder to write to. If NULL, results will not be written to file}

\item{databaseId}{database identifier}

\item{filename}{output file name, if NULL it will be equal to databaseId}
}
\value{
named list with results
}
