<p>The drug dose check is only output “overall”. Yet it contains the
strata unit, unit and route, and unit and route and pattern_id. The
pattern refers to rows in the drug_strength table. The drug strength
table has around 120 different patterns. Yet only around 40 of those
make sense clinically. The dose is estimated for pre-specified drug
strength patterns. To know the level of detail, there is a variable
called pattern name (more explanation below for this variable).<br>
The output of the drug dose check is a “summarised result”. More
information can be found here: <a href="https://darwin-eu-dev.github.io/omopgenerics/articles/a04_summarised_result.html" class="external-link uri">https://darwin-eu-dev.github.io/omopgenerics/articles/a04_summarised_result.html</a>
The result is a “summarised result” because we use the function
<code>dailyDoseCoverage()</code> from the DrugUtilisation R Package. <a href="https://darwin-eu-dev.github.io/DrugUtilisation/reference/dailyDoseCoverage.html" class="external-link uri">https://darwin-eu-dev.github.io/DrugUtilisation/reference/dailyDoseCoverage.html</a></p>

<td align="left">The pattern name contains the information of the level
of detail as follows: “overall” is the overall dose estimation (beware
that units may be mixed up, e.g. international units and milligrams),
therefore the more sensible thing to look at is at “unit” level: if the
pattern_name says “milligram”, “milliliter”, or any other unit alone,
you are in the “unit” strata. This means that the estimated dose has the
unit shown in pattern_name. Thus, if there are two different units for
any ingredient, it means that there are drug concept with different
units. The next more detailed level is “route and unit”, this depicts as
“oral milligram” for example. So you know that this strata contains all
oral dose forms that have the unit milligram. Thus, the depicted daily
dose also has the unit milligram. The final level of detail is “unit,
route, drug_strength pattern”. This shows as “milligram oral
milligram_milligram” meaning the drug strength pattern is milligram
(numerator) by milligram (denominator), there is also the possibility of
milligram_missing_milligram for example if the denominator value is
missing and it is a non-quantified drug. Another option are fixed amount
drug strength pattern (if only amount is filled and numerator and
denominator are missing). These patterns are mainly used for solid dose
forms (pills, suppositories. etc). Drug strength pattern come from the
DRUG_STRENGTH table and are pre-specified for each drug (mainly
depending on their units and wether they are fixed amounts of
concentration or time based drugs). More information on drug strength
patterns can be found in the paper on how to estimate daily dose in OMOP
